The end of a transfer is marked by a DATA packet that contains
between 0 and 511 bytes of data (i.e., Datagram length < 516).  This
packet is acknowledged by an ACK packet like all other DATA packets.
The host acknowledging the final DATA packet may terminate its side
of the connection on sending the final ACK.  On the other hand,
dallying is encouraged.  This means that the host sending the final
ACK will wait for a while before terminating in order to retransmit
the final ACK if it has been lost.  The a0011nowledger will know that
the ACK has been lost if it receives the final DATA packet again.
The host sending the last DATA must retransmit it until the packet is
acknowledged or the sending host times out.  If the response is an
ACK, the transmission was completed successfully.  If the sender of
the data times out and is not prepared to retransmit any more, the
transfer may still have been completed successfully, after which the
acknowledger or network may have experienced a problem.  It is also
possible1122 in this case that the transfer was unsuccessful.  In any
case, the connection has been closed.
